## Installation

### 1. Install the Chrome Extension

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the ReplyAI folder
5. The extension will appear in your extensions list

### 2. Set up n8n Workflow

You'll need to create an n8n workflow to handle the AI processing. Here's what the workflow should do:

#### Workflow Structure

1. Webhook Trigger: Receives POST requests from the extension
2. AI Processing Node: Processes the request and generates replies
3. Response Node: Returns the generated reply

#### Expected Request Format

The extension sends POST requests with this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "tone": "professional",
  "originalPost": "Which language is best to start DSA?",
  "userContext": {
    "username": "",
    "displayName": "",
    "followers": "",
    "following": "",
    "currentUrl": "https://twitter.com/...",
    "pageTitle": "X"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:00.000Z",
  "extensionVersion": "1.0.0"
}
```

#### Expected Response Format

Your n8n workflow should return a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "reply": "For DSA, I'd recommend starting with Python. It's beginner-friendly with clean syntax and extensive libraries. Once comfortable, you can explore C++ for deeper understanding of memory management.",
  "success": true,
  "tone": "professional"
}
```

#### Sample n8n Workflow

Here's a basic n8n workflow structure you can use:

1. Webhook Node:
   - Method: POST
   - Path: `/xbot-webhook`
   - Authentication: Optional (recommended for production)

2. AI Service Node (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, etc.):
   - Use the `tone` and `originalPost` from the webhook
   - Generate a reply based on the specified tone
   - Keep replies under 280 characters for X

3. Respond to Webhook Node:
   - Return the generated reply in the expected format

#### Example AI Prompt Template

```
You are an AI assistant helping users generate replies to X (Twitter) posts. 

Original Post: {{$json.originalPost}}

Generate a reply in a {{$json.tone}} tone. The reply should:
- Be engaging and relevant to the original post
- Match the specified tone ({{$json.tone}})
- Be under 280 characters
- Be natural and conversational
- Add value to the conversation

Tone Guidelines:
- Professional: Formal, business-like, authoritative
- Casual: Friendly, relaxed, conversational
- Humorous: Funny, witty, light-hearted
- Empathetic: Understanding, supportive, caring
- Analytical: Logical, data-driven, thoughtful
- Enthusiastic: Excited, positive, energetic
