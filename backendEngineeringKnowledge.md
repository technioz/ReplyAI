## Database Engineering & Optimization

### Relational Databases (SQL)

PostgreSQL Optimization
PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database. Common optimization techniques include:
- Index optimization: B-tree indexes for equality/range queries, GiST for geometric data, GIN for full-text search
- Query planning: Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query execution paths
- Connection pooling: Tools like PgBouncer reduce connection overhead
- Partitioning: Table partitioning for large datasets (range, list, hash partitioning)
- Vacuum operations: Regular maintenance to reclaim storage and update statistics
- Materialized views: Pre-computed query results for complex aggregations

Real-world impact: Optimizing a poorly indexed PostgreSQL database can reduce query times from 2-3 seconds to 50-100ms, directly improving user experience and reducing server load.

MySQL/MariaDB Performance
- InnoDB storage engine: ACID-compliant with row-level locking
- Query cache considerations: Deprecated in MySQL 8.0+ due to scalability issues
- Replication strategies: Master-slave, master-master, group replication
- Sharding patterns: Application-level vs database-level sharding
- Slow query log analysis: Identifying bottlenecks

Database Indexing Strategies
- Clustered vs non-clustered indexes
- Composite indexes: Order matters (selectivity principle)
- Index selectivity: High cardinality columns benefit most
- Covering indexes: Include all queried columns to avoid table lookups
- Partial indexes: Index subset of rows based on conditions
- Index maintenance overhead: Balance read speed vs write performance

### NoSQL Databases

MongoDB Best Practices
- Document modeling: Embedding vs referencing trade-offs
- Index types: Single field, compound, multikey, text, geospatial, hashed
- Aggregation pipeline: $match, $group, $project, $lookup stages
- Sharding strategies: Range-based, hash-based, zone sharding
- Read concerns: local, available, majority, linearizable
- Write concerns: acknowledged, journaled, replica acknowledged
- Connection pooling: Default pool size of 100, tune based on workload

Real-world scenario: A SaaS company migrated from embedded documents to referenced collections, reducing document size by 70% and improving query performance for frequently accessed data.

Redis for Caching & Sessions
- Data structures: Strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs
- Cache eviction policies: LRU, LFU, TTL-based expiration
- Pub/Sub messaging: Real-time event broadcasting
- Redis Cluster: Automatic sharding across multiple nodes
- Persistence options: RDB snapshots vs AOF (append-only file)
- Use cases: Session storage, real-time leaderboards, rate limiting, job queues

Performance impact: Implementing Redis cache layer reduced database queries by 80% and API response times from 400ms to 40ms.

DynamoDB & Cassandra

## API Development & Architecture

### RESTful API Design

REST Principles & Best Practices
- Resource-based URLs: /users/{id} not /getUser
- HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove)
- Status codes: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error)
- Idempotency: GET, PUT, DELETE should be idempotent
- Versioning strategies: URL-based (/v1/), header-based, content negotiation
- HATEOAS: Hypermedia links for API discoverability
- Pagination: Cursor-based vs offset-based pagination
- Rate limiting: Token bucket, leaky bucket algorithms
- Authentication: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0, API keys

Real-world example: Implementing cursor-based pagination reduced API response times by 60% for large datasets and eliminated inconsistent results during active data changes.

API Performance Optimization
